Implementing cURL in an XAMPP environment for the first time can cause a quick, early headache.  The most common error seen is a simple curl_init() can not be found.  Luckily, the solution is most likely simple. Â  cURL comes included with Apache but not installed, so you have to go in and turn it on yourself.

Open up your php.ini located under the /php directory.  The line that needs editing will read: ;extension=php_curl.dll.  Simply remove the semi-colon to uncomment the line.  Then restart Apache to finish the change!
