I came across <a title="Neighborhood Flags" href="http://awesome.good.is/projects/neighborhood-flags/index.html">this project</a> for Good magazine in which a collection of designers and illustrators were called upon to design flags for their respective neighborhoods.  Some were beautiful in their simplicity, others appeared to be the product of designers trying to show of their skills rather than fit the creative limitations.

Needless to say, I went for the more simplistic route in designing a flag for my Boston-area neighborhood, Davis Square.
