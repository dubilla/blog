The ambiguity of the narrator on this Post Secret really struck a chord.  The possibilities of all three roles are endless and striking.  Why did the male lead leave?  What is the female lead doing in the meanwhile?  We do know the male character is coming back; it's simply a matter of when.  How is the narrator related to either of the main characters?  And what to make of the starry, dreamy night sky backdrop?

It works because the reader has enough information to create their own version of the story.  What's your version?
