Nearly two weeks ago, the violence that has been perpetuated against Asian Americans continued as six Asian Americans and eight people in total were killed in an act of domestic terror in Georgia. The violence was an attack predicated on racial stereotypes that have for too long pervaded American culture. Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Sun Cha Kim, and Yong Ae Yue lived lives. Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng lived lives.

If you’re reading this, there’s a chance you work in tech. Maybe you’re on a team. You might even lead an engineering team. All of these teams: comprised of people. The trick is you don’t know which of these people might be hurting this month. You might not know how people identify, how their people might identify, and how these tragedies can bring up their own pain.

If you’re Asian American, if you have friends and family who identify as Asian American, I cannot pretend to understand what you’re feeling. And I’m sorry that this country has created a place where this is possible, where this happens. I will do everything I can to stop Asian hate.

It costs nothing to be kind. Be understanding. Be forgiving. Everyone is always carrying something. Right now, some people are carrying a whole lot more. Check in where appropriate, create space where you can, and meet people where they want to be met. If you find yourself in a position where you can be an ally, educate yourself. If you find yourself in a place where folks are gracious enough to teach you, listen.

Take care of those around you and let that care compound.
