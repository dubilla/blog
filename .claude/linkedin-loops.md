Lately while experimenting with LLMs, I've found myself creating learning loops.

I spent months trying to identify the "right" places to use AI. Despite thinking about engineering workflows all day, identifying my own felt daunting. After a while, I stumbled into a  habit: use an LLM for something small and purpose-driven, learn what worked and what didn't, then find another opportunity to try again.

The breakthrough wasn't any single use case. It was the compounding. I found myself using two of my commonly-used principles:
1. When you're uncertain, make moves that collect information.
2. Where possible, compound knowledge.

This pattern reminded me of some of my early programming lessons - once you learn to accomplish a task, you subsequently learn how to accomplish it repeatedly.

If you're feeling uncertain about where to use new tools — AI or otherwise — don't wait to identify the perfect application. Start small, create feedback loops, and let the system become self-propelling.

Have you built any learning loops lately?
